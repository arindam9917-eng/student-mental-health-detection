## System Architecture

This folder describes the overall system architecture of the Student Mental Health Detection project.

The architecture follows a three-tier design:
1. Frontend – Student data collection interface
2. Backend – API layer for handling requests and predictions
3. Machine Learning Engine – Trained model and preprocessing pipeline

The design ensures modularity, scalability, and separation of concerns.
