# 🎓 Student Mental Health Detection using Machine Learning

This project was developed as a **final year academic project** to analyze and predict
mental health risk among students using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Mental health issues among students are increasing due to academic pressure, lifestyle,
financial stress, and lack of support. Early detection can help in timely intervention.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
- Analyze student mental health data
- Predict depression risk using machine learning
- Classify risk levels as **Low / Medium / High**
- Provide a simple and interpretable output

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system follows a **three-tier architecture**:

1. **Frontend**
   - Student input form
   - Displays prediction result

2. **Backend (FastAPI)**
   - Handles API requests
   - Preprocesses input data
   - Communicates with ML model

3. **Machine Learning Engine**
   - Trained classification model
   - Feature encoding and scaling
   - Probability-based risk prediction
